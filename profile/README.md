# [Prime IT Club](https://www.primeitclub.com/about)

[Prime IT Club](https://www.primeitclub.com/about) is one of the student-run clubs at Prime College. It is run by a group of creative and tech-savvy students. With our goal in mind, we organize a series of sessions, seminars, training programs and competitions. Since our founding in 2004, we have been and still are looking for opportunities to help students in any way possible and all we have set out is to strive to guide students in the right direction.
